## Instructions

The goal of this exercise is to create a demo RESTful application using Golang.

### The Task

In this task, we are building the backend of an application that helps us managing our team.

#### Features and Requirements
  A member 
     has a name and a type, the late one can be an employee or a contractor - if it's a contractor, the duration of the contract needs to be saved. And if it's an employee we need to store their location 
     has a role, for instance: Software Engineer, Project Manager and so on
     can be tagged, for instance: C#, Angular, General Frontend, Seasoned Leader and so on. (Tags will likely be used as filters later, so keep that in mind)
    
We need to offer a RESTful CRUD for all the information above.

#### Notes:

1. You can use any Golang framework
2. Make sure to provide a tutorial on how to run your application
3. Feel free to use any database

#### Bonus points:

1. If you add automated tests
2. If you provide a Docker image
